Directions
1 Heat oven to 300Â°F. Line 8-inch square pan with heavy-duty foil so foil extends over sides of pan. Spray foil with cooking spray. In small bowl, mix crust ingredients. Press in bottom of sprayed foil-lined pan.
2 In large bowl, beat cream cheese until smooth. Add remaining filling ingredients; beat until smooth. Pour filling over crust.
3 Bake 40 to 45 minutes or until edges are set. Center will be soft but will set when cool. Refrigerate 1 1/2 hours or until chilled. Freeze cheesecake about 2 hours or until firm.
4 Remove cheesecake from pan by lifting foil. Cut into 48 pieces; remove from foil and place on sheet of waxed paper.
5 In 1-quart saucepan, melt coating ingredients over low heat, stirring frequently until smooth. Cool 2 to 3 minutes or until slightly cooled. Place in 2-cup measuring cup.
6 Spear each cheesecake bite with fork; dip in melted chocolate to cover bottom and sides, letting excess drip off. Place on waxed paper.
7 Spoon about 1 teaspoon melted chocolate over each bite, smoothing top with back of spoon. Let stand about 20 minutes or until firm. Store in refrigerator.
Expert Tips
Sliced into large squares, this cheesecake makes an elegant dessert. Arrange single-serving squares on a platter or on dessert plates. Transfer melted chocolate to a plastic squeeze bottle or a small resealable plastic bag. Snip a tiny corner from the bag. Artfully drizzle the plate and the cheesecake with melted chocolate. Try other crumbs for the crust. Crush chocolate or cinnamon graham crackers, or chocolate or vanilla wafers. Dipping forks are angled just right for dipping into melted chocolate.
